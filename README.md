# Mesh Micro Rollup 

It provides the features like Game Forking instanenously from user's end without going through lots of hassels in Smart Contract Forking & Chain Forking.

Forking & Mods will allow any user to create a fork of the state on L2 and start a new state transitions for their demands.

This is similar to authors writing fiction and cults driving the fan-fiction versions from it.
